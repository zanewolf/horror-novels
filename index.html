        <p>The top 20 horror novels were selected from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/3371.The_Definitive_Horror_Book_List">Goodread's Definitive Horror Book List</a> and the data was provided by <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/4265096">Zenodo's Best Books Ever Dataset</a>.</p>
        <p>
            Regarding genres: after cleaning to remove genres that were common to every book ('Horror', 'Fiction'), genres that were a combination of two or more genres (e.g. 'Mystery Thriller', 'Science Fiction Fantasy'), 'genres' that described a type of media (e.g. 'Classics','Short Stories', 'Audiobooks', 'Gothic', 'Adult', 'Poetry'), there were 19 remaining. These remaining genres were collapsed into five main categories: <span class="fantasy">Fantasy</span> ('Fantasy'/'Urban Fantasy'); <span class="thriller">Thriller</span> ('Thriller'/'Mystery'/'Suspense'); <span class="supernatural">Supernatural</span> ('Supernatural'/'Paranormal'/'Vampires'/'Ghosts'/'Zombies'); <span class="scifi">Scifi</span> ('Science Fiction'/'Dystopia'/'Apocalyptic'/'Post Apocalyptic'); and <span class="drama">Drama/Crime</span> ('Drama'/'Crime'). Three of the 19 genres were ultimately not represented, but each was applicable to only one book: 'Religion', 'Historical Fiction', and 'Psychological Thriller'.
        </p>
        <p>Regarding ages: When there were discrepancies between the first publication date provided in the Zenodo dataset and the Goodread's date, the Goodread's date was used.  </p>
